This is a project to demonstrate basic encryption for Android. I did it for my local pool league so still lots of bugs but I thought it was a pretty good example of how to do this. Remember 2 things...

1.) If a user gets root you are screwed regardless because the key is stored there. 
2.) You need a new IV everytime FOR EVERY ENCRYPTED PROPERTY! so make sure you keep those up to date. 

Feel free to comment/help. I am not very organized.
